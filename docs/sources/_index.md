# Explore Logs documentation

Explore Logs lets you answer observability questions without writing queries.

The app proactively surfaces insights by analyzing your log streams. It organizes logs by labels, values, detected fields, and patterns, showing you log volumes and allowing you to easily drill down by clicking through the graphs.

You can always get to the logs themselves, but for some use cases the volume graphs are enough.
