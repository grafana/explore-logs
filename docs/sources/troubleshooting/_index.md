# Troubleshooting

{{< docs/public-preview product="Explore Logs" >}}

This page address common issues when getting started and using Explore Logs.

## Ensure Loki is properly configured

To use Explore Logs, you need to have Loki properly configured. You can find full instructions on how to do this when [installing Explore Logs]({{< relref "../access" >}}).

## There are no services

If everything is presented as an `unknown_service` when you access Explore Logs, you can try the following fixes:

1. Ensure the Volume API is enabled by setting the [`volume_enabled` configuration value](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#:~:text=volume_enabled) in Loki. Enabled by default in Loki 3.1 and later.
1. Specify the label to use to identify services by setting the [`discover_service_name` configuration value](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#:~:text=discover_service_name) in Loki.

## There are no detected levels

If you do not see `detected_level` values in Explore Logs, you can try the following fixes:

1. Ensure level detection is enabled by setting the [`discover_log_levels` configuration value](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#:~:text=discover_log_levels). Enabled by default in Loki 3.1 and later.

## There are no labels

If you do not see any labels in Explore Logs, you can try the following fixes:

1. Ensure your collector is properly configured to attach them.

To learn more about Labels, refer to the [Loki labels documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/).

## There are no patterns

Patterns are ephemeral and will only be available for the last 3 hours.

If you aren't getting any patterns, you can try the following fixes:

1. Ensure pattern extraction is enabled by setting `--pattern-ingester.enabled=true` in your Loki config. [Learn about other necessary config](../get-started/#install-using-grafana-cli).
1. It is possible that no patterns were detected, although this is rare - please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/1sYWCTPvD72T1dPH9) so we can see what's going on.

## I cannot find something

Please [get in touch with the team building the app](https://forms.gle/1sYWCTPvD72T1dPH9) and let us know what's not working for you.

Support tickets are not in scope for products or features in public preview. However, we are always looking to improve the experience and would love to hear from you.
